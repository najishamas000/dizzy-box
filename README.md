The Castle
avant garde choose your own adventure game. you get asked weird questions that construct themselves
using randomly indexed semantic tokens and then you have to do something about it (draw/select images) with no further instructions.
it's art. it's not meant to be challenging like a traditional game.  runs on a raspberry pi with a small LCD screen that comes with a stylus.
game made in python, environment structured using bash.
rugged and disorganized code due to having to hack things together within a little under a week.
video demo coming soon.
