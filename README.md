# The Castle
avant garde choose your own adventure concept-game, designed for an art installation. you get asked weird questions that construct themselves
using randomly indexed semantic tokens and then you have to respond to them subjectively (draw/select images) with no further instructions.
it's art. it's not meant to be challenging like a traditional game.  runs on a raspberry pi with a small LCD screen that comes with a stylus.
game made in python, environment structured using bash/UNIX.
disorganized monolithic code due to having to hack things together within a little under a week to meet a submission deadline without risking the integrity of the program.
video demo coming soon.
